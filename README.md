Steps to design a Python framework for an image compression algorithm:

Choose a compression algorithm: The first step is to select an image compression algorithm that you want to implement. Some popular algorithms are JPEG, PNG, and GIF.

Install the necessary libraries: Once you have chosen your compression algorithm, you need to install the necessary libraries to implement it.We are using JPEG compression then we install pillow library.

Create a class for the compression algorithm: Next, we create a class for  compression algorithm. This class should contain methods for compressing and decompressing images, also we included methods for setting compression parameters.

Create a function to read images: Create a function to read images from disk or from memory.

Create a function to write compressed images: Create a function to write compressed images to disk or memory.

Create a function to compress images: Create a function that takes an image as input and returns the compressed image.

Create a function to decompress images: Create a function that takes a compressed image as input and returns the decompressed image.

Test your framework: Finally,we test for the framework by compressing and decompressing various types of images and comparing the results with the original images.
